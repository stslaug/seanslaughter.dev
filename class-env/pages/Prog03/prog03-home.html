				<div class = "paragraph-with-div"><p> The world of Greyhawk, one of the oldest and most
					celebrated settings in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, invites adventurers to brave
					ancient ruins, scheme in bustling city-states, and challenge mighty wizards. From the
					bustling Free City of Greyhawk to the distant shores of the Sea Princes, countless
					factions rise and fall across a land steeped in tradition and mystery. Heroes and villains
					alike leave indelible marks on history, their stories woven into legends whispered over
					tavern tables and in the echoing halls of the Great Library. </p>
					<aside><b>Did You Know?</b><br> Greyhawk was created by Gary Gygax, co-creator of D&D, and
						is often referred to as the “granddaddy” of official D&D campaign settings.
					</aside>
				</div>
				<p><b>Character creation</b> in Greyhawk often draws from a wide variety of cultures and
					regions. Whether a roguish mercenary born in the urban sprawl of the Free City, or a
					ranger patrolling the fringes of the Gnarley Forest, each character’s background
					influences their outlook and skills. Political alliances can run deep, and a hero’s patron
					deity or organization might sway local powers that be. Clerics of Pelor might find
					themselves welcomed in many hamlets, whereas devotees of darker gods remain perpetually in
					the shadows, their loyalties suspected by common folk. </p>
				<div class = "paragraph-with-div">
					<aside><b>Greyhawk Tip:</b><br> Incorporate local legends—like the tales of Vecna or the
						machinations of Iuz the Old—into character backstories to ground them firmly in the
						setting.
					</aside>
					<p> <b>Advancement</b> in Greyhawk, as in other D&D settings, often rewards both martial
						prowess and roleplaying ingenuity. Adventurers might earn experience not only from
						slaying monsters or foiling bandits, but also from cleverly navigating court
						intrigue or negotiating peace among warring baronies. Mastering the delicate balance
						between swords and diplomacy can prove as critical as a well-timed fireball. Over
						time, characters gain influence within the domain, securing strongholds, forging
						alliances, and shaping the very politics of the region. </p></div>
				<p> <b>Rewards</b> go beyond simple gold or magic items. Personal achievements and renown
					can
					open
					doors that remain locked to lesser-known adventurers. Scholars and collectors pay
					handsomely for rare artifacts, and ancient tomes might contain spells found nowhere else
					on Oerth. Restored relics bring fame, while alliances with powerful wizards or paladins
					offer potent boons. Yet with each step up the ladder of power, characters draw the
					attention of formidable foes, proving the old axiom that every reward in Greyhawk comes at
					a cost. </p>
